# Smart-Prosthetic-ARM

        There are lot of people in the world who are living without a hand . Because of that they are face a lot of problematic situations in day to day life . A smart prosthetic arm gives a feel to disable people that they have a real hand. It automatically detect the object and provide a suitable grip to pick the object.
        
        With available prosthetic arms , they can’t pick objects properly . It is too complex to imlipent all kind of grips machanically. Doesn’t change the grip according to object. Lifting more weight is uncomfortable to patient. Doesn’t save a patient history . 
        
        Our project is Reduce mechanical parts so reduce the weight ,Vision based solution , Use machine learing to give the correct grip according to object , Real time operation , Cloud base user history tracking .
